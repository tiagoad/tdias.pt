I finally got around to get a proper personal site online, just in time for 
the new year. Hopefully I'll add some content throughout the year.

It's built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a really fast static site
generator written in Rust. Their documentation is very good and you don't need
to learn much to have a very personalized website up and running. 
The templating system is very powerful, and it comes with everything I need
built in.

The site is automatically built by [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
and uploaded to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

If you're curious, all the code is available on
[this github repo](https://github.com/tiagoad/tdias.pt).
