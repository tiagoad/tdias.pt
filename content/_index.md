I'm a software developer from [Lisbon, Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon).

I like learning new stuff and talking about what I learned, and I hope to bring
a bit of that online with this blog. 

I'm interested in all aspects of software engineering, and engineering in general.
I've been very interested in electronics as a hobby for many years, but I'm not getting that much better with time.
I love taking pictures, and I'm a big lover of nature.

You can contact me for any reason at [tiago@tdias.pt](mailto:tiago@tdias.pt).
