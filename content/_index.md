I'm Tiago, a software developer from Lisbon (Portugal).

I don't really aim to be a specialist in any specific field, moving up and down
the stack as needed by whatever I'm working on.

Mostly by coincidence, I've worked quite a bit in web scraping and automation 
systems in the past (professionally). I've also done some data visualization for fun.

This is my personal website and blog, where I'll post occasionally and publish some of my personal projects.

## Projects

- [Portugal COVID19 Charts](https://covid19.tdias.pt/) - Some charts I've been working on since the beginning of the pandemic. Built with pandas and matplotlib through Github Actions, using [data](https://github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data) from Data Science for Social Good Portugal.
